### 2. Code Study:

* unzip -qq

-q perform operations quietly (-qq = even quieter). Ordinarily unzip prints the names of the files it's extracting or testing, the extrac‐ tion methods, any file or zipfile comments that may be stored in the archive, and possibly a summary when finished with each archive. The -qq options suppress the printing of some or all of these messages.
